I want to make the SVG element for a color picker like the one in Paint Tool SAI. Make a SVG (the HTML element, not the .svg file) that has a circumference with an outer width of 100 and an inner with of 90, with red at the top, and clockwise the hue increases until meeting red at the top again after a full circle. Inside, there should be a triangle equilateral with the top corner red, the bottom-left one black, and the bottom-right white, so that any pixel in between is a lerp() based on distance to the three corners. Make sure to use gradients or similar, and reason deeply about what SVG features to use to make this possible with a minimal, super simple SVG, so that nothing else can be stripped. Feel free to make multiple iterations until achieving perfection, and be critical in your reviews.
