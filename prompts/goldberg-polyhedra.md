Generate a minimal three.js standalone HTML file with two sliders m (from 1 to 20) and n (from 0 to 20), that upon changing the slider, generates the Goldberg Polyhedra (m, n). You can do that by rotating a triangle in an isometric grid, using it to build a geodesic sphere, and computing the its dual polyhedron. Or any other method that you deem best. When loading the page, (m=3, n=2) should be selected, and you should dispatch an event to generate it for the first time. Clearly separate the three.js rendering from the polyhedra generation.
